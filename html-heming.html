<em><strong>How to Bring Public Participation in Walkability?</strong></em>
</head>

<body>
    <p>
    The current analysis of walkability is mostly only focus on the quantitative data or physical conditions of built environment. However, as social creatures, pedestrians are more influenced by social and economic characteristics. For example,  Chinatown, which is ranked as the third most walkable neighborhood by Walk Score, is facing dramatically changes and suffering poor physical conditions. If the local businesses are replaced by young professional businesses, and Chinatown has some beatification projects, then I am afraid this neighborhood will lose its affordability and the gathering places for low-income immigrants, which may destroy the local culture and social networks. 
    </p>
    <p>The majority of researchers and planners more depends on observation rather than interactive survey. Lacking public participation and real engagement is one of the the key issue here. For instance, in some report, they compared Chinatown with other neighborhoods and design guides and said Chinatown is lacking bike racks, sidewalk seats, and the intercity bus station is a problem for pedestrians. This statement is true, but the issues they identified are not the real demands or problems for locals. Only a few researchers tried to develop some qualitative research, but they are still lacking systematical analysis on how to design conversation.</p>
